# Elevator Finite State Machine

Designed and implemented a Verilog-based finite state machine (FSM) to control a three-story elevator system, integrating accurate button functionality. Ensured that all seven elevator button inputs remained active until their requests were completed, such as keeping a floor call button lit until the elevator arrived and opened its doors. Verified functionality through waveform simulations using ModelSim and Cadence, demonstrating the system's ability to manage multi-floor stops, button clears, and door operations as specified in the design hierarchy.
